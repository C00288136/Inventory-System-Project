# Inventory Managment Portal

## Overview

This project is based on the stock management system design developed last semester. It's an inventory tracking portal designed for efficient navigation between different inventory tables, with a left-hand side navigation bar serving as a quick switch between panels.

## Key Features

- **Navigation Bar**: Links to different pages including stock items, orders, sales pages, and a settings page for account password modifications.

- **Card Layout for Data Display**: Using a card layout, the main panel presents relevant data, with navigation bar buttons for switching between panels.

- **Vibrant Theme**: The design features a white and purple theme for clarity and contrast. Further iterations might include customizable color schemes and a dark mode.

- **Data Visualization**: Leveraging the JFreeChart library, a line graph represents sales' total revenue over the past three months. Other vital information, like the number of suppliers, the database's item count, total sales, recent orders, and best-selling items, is also displayed.

- **Dynamic Tables**: Tables displaying corresponding database data also include options for adding, deleting, and amending entries.

- **Database Interaction**: The sales and orders tables utilize Jcomboboxs enabling users to enter only StockIDs present in the database, avoiding potential issues. 

## Future Improvements

The plan is to implement a feature within the settings page that enables users to customize the color scheme throughout the program, and also to create a dark mode for the system.
